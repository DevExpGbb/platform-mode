# Platform Mode

Platform Mode is designed to provide a tailored chat experience specifically for platform engineering tasks. By enabling a custom mode, teams can streamline workflows, automate repetitive processes, and ensure consistent application of best practices across infrastructure and development operations. This focused environment helps platform engineers collaborate efficiently, manage complex systems, and accelerate delivery while maintaining high standards of reliability and security.

 This code is designed to support a custom chat mode tailored for integration with modern Azure-based reference architectures,
 such as the one described at https://humanitec.com/reference-architectures/azure. In such architectures, organizations leverage
 a combination of Azure-native services (e.g., Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure DevOps, Azure Active Directory, and managed databases)
 alongside developer tooling for streamlined CI/CD, infrastructure automation, and secure, scalable application delivery.
 
 The need for a custom chat mode arises from the complexity and diversity of tools and workflows present in these environments.
 By providing a specialized chat interface, this code enables:
   - Context-aware assistance for developers and operators working within Azure-centric cloud-native stacks.
   - Integration with deployment pipelines, infrastructure-as-code, and monitoring solutions common in the reference architecture.
   - Enhanced collaboration and troubleshooting by surfacing relevant information and automating routine queries or actions.
 
 This approach helps bridge gaps between development, operations, and security teams, ensuring that communication and automation
 are aligned with the best practices and patterns established in the Azure reference architecture.
